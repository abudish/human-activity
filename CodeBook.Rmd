### 1. Project goal
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate student's ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The result is a tidy dataset that follows [tidy data principles](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf). 

### 2. Initial Dataset Description
**Abstract:** _Human Activity Recognition database built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors._  

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.  

A video of the experiment including an example of the 6 recorded activities with one of the participants can be seen in the following link: [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOEN9W05_4A)  


**For each record in the dataset it is provided:  **  
 + Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.  
 + Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope.  
 + A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.  
 + Its activity label.     
 + An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.  

**The dataset includes the following files:  **

- 'README.txt'

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

**The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent.  **

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second. 

**Notes:  **  
- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].  
- Each feature vector is a row on the text file.


The dataset is taken from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).

### 3. Initial dataset features (variables)
**Feature Selection**  
The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.  

tBodyAcc-XYZ  
tGravityAcc-XYZ  
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ  
tBodyGyro-XYZ  
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ  
tBodyAccMag  
tGravityAccMag  
tBodyAccJerkMag  
tBodyGyroMag  
tBodyGyroJerkMag  
fBodyAcc-XYZ  
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ  
fBodyGyro-XYZ  
fBodyAccMag  
fBodyAccJerkMag  
fBodyGyroMag  
fBodyGyroJerkMag  

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are:  

mean(): Mean value  
std(): Standard deviation  
mad(): Median absolute deviation  
max(): Largest value in array  
min(): Smallest value in array  
sma(): Signal magnitude area  
energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values.  
iqr(): Interquartile range  
entropy(): Signal entropy  
arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4  
correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals  
maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude  
meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency  
skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal  
kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal  
bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.  
angle(): Angle between to vectors.  

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:  

gravityMean  
tBodyAccMean  
tBodyAccJerkMean  
tBodyGyroMean  
tBodyGyroJerkMean  

The complete list of variables of each feature vector is available in ['features.txt'](https://github.com/abudish/human-activity/blob/master/data/UCI%20HAR%20Dataset/features.txt)    

### 4. Data proccessing to make tidy dataset
 
To make this tidy dataset, `Run_analysis.R` script was created that does the next steps:  
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.  
2. Extracts only the measurements of the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.  
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.  
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.  
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

To create a `tidy_data.txt` file, one should run `Run_analisis.R` - [link to the script](https://github.com/abudish/human-activity/blob/master/Run_analysis.R)  
What this script does is described in detail in the [ReadMe.md](https://github.com/abudish/human-activity/blob/master/README.md)  

### 5. Tidy data description
After running `Run_analisis.R`, a tidy dataset file is created `tidy_data.txt`.   
The file can be read using this commands:  
```r
# Just copy paste this commands into the console and hit Enter
address <- "https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera-uploads/peer-review/59282c066c1e4e06adbc8f39a16b599b/tidy_data.txt"
address <- sub("^https", "http", address)
require(dplyr)
tidy_url <- read.table(url(address), header = TRUE) %>% as.tbl()
```

Tidy dataset has next dimensions:
15480 observations and 4 variables.  
Variables are: `subject, activity_type, sensor_measurment` and `average_value`.  
**There are 30 subjects, performing 6 types of activites, with 86 different sensor measurement for each of the activity.**  

**Each observation (row) is an average value of a specific sensor measurment, of a particular individual performing one of the activities.**
